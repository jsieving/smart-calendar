## Conclusions Drawn from Feedback

Are there features you think will not be useful or appropriate?
* Based on the responses to this question, the features we are working on and the ones we have in mind seem “appropriate” and “pretty simple.”

Are there any other features you think we should include?
* One person mentioned security of user data, however, this issue is handled through the Google Calendar security features so we don’t need to worry about it.
* Another person asked if we can handle recurring events. Our thinking is that if a person wants to have a recurring event they would want the event to occur at the same time every day or every week, so this type of event would be manually scheduled, not automatically scheduled by the algorithm.

What improvements would you recommend for the structure of our code?
 * One of the most relevant pieces of advice was “interface early and often.” We started interfacing quite early on, and we are continuing to work on interfacing.


## Reflection on AR and Future Plans

The most helpful part of this Architectural Review was having a deadline to work toward. We decided to do a live demo of the interface between Python and Google Calendar during the AR which gave us something to work towards. We also used the AR as a reason to reorganize our code.

We have a pretty clear idea of the program structure and the data storage methods, and we are focusing in on the main scheduling algorithm.

Our future plans include finishing the scheduling algorithm. The most difficult part of the project we are working on now is preference calculations. We also want to incorporate past user behaviours. We are considering bringing back the idea of an SMS interface once we finish our MVP, but that would be a stretch goal.
