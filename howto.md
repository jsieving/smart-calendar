# Running Our Web App
Our application was built to run off the linux terminal. If you are also using the linux terminal follow the steps below. If not skip to the [Windows installation section](#contact_form).

### Installing Dependencies
The use of third-party code for interactions with Google and SciPy require additional libraries to be downloaded. Copy and paste the line below into the terminal in order to install all the necessary packages:

```
pip install datetime httplib2 oauth2client apiclient ortools flask
```
### Connecting the Program to Google Calendar
In order to interact with your personal Google Calendar, the program needs an api key from your google account. This [link](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python) will show you how to download the right file (follow step 1 only).
